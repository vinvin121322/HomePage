        <p>Algebraic equation</p>

        <p><b>Algebraic equation,</b> statement of the equality of two expression formulated by applying to a set of variables the algebraic operations, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising to a power, and extraction of a root. Examples are x<sup>3</sup> + 1 and (y<sup>4</sup>x<sup>2</sup> + 2xy - y)/(x - 1) =12. An important special case of such equations is that of polynomial equations, expressions of the form axn + bxn<sup>-1</sup> + ... + gx + h = k. They have as many solutions as their degree (n), and the search for their soltions stimulated much of the development of classical and modern algebra. Equations like x sin (x) = c that involve nonalgebraic operations, such as logarithms or trigonemetric functions, are said to be transcendental.</p>

        <p>Chemical compound</p>

        <p>A chemical compound is a chemical substance consisting of two or more different chemically bonded chemical elements, with a fixed ratio determinig the composition.</p>

        <p>The ration of each element is usually expressed by chemical formula.</p>

        <p>For example, water (H<sub>2</sub>O is a compound of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom.</p>

        <p>The atoms within a compound can be held together by a variety of interactions, ranging from covalent bonds to electrostatic forces in ionic bonds.</p>

        <p>A continuum of bond polarities exist between the purely covalent bonds.</p>

        <p>Sodium chloride is an example of an ionic compound.</p>
